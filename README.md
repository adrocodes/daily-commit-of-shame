# Daily Commit of Shame

![You vs the guy she tells you not to worry about](./readme/meme.jpg)

It is time to become the other guy. This simple Next app will run a CRON job every night at 11:00pm (roughly, Vercel doesn't guarantee on time execution on lower pricing tiers), if you haven't made a commit it will create a issue for you on a repo. Since issues count as commits you will never miss another day, but they are public, so everyone will know your shame.
